## II Goal
simulate the motion of two blocks sliding on fixed verticle axes, connected to each other by springs. because we like Kuo An.

## III Step
1. Write down the lagrangian

2. Put it in python language

3. Simulate

4. Create gorgeous visual interface for setting parameter.

## V Work Log

 Week 1:
   1. Started to search for physical simulation online, tried to download Vpython and failed.
   2. Write down the lagrangian and find the solution in complex form.
   
 Week 2:
   1. Tried to download Vpython and failed again.
   2. Gave up on Vpython-powered 3D animation, turned to animation.FuncAnimation, obtained y-t graph and 2D simulation.
   
 Week 3:
   1. Realized the animation looked oddly unrealistic, check for bug. Added complex conjugate to the solution and got much better. 
   2. Drew the phase diagram for both masses.
   
 Week 4:
   1. Set up GUI to control parameters of the system.
   2. Debug and refine.
   
 Week 5:
   1. Create "random" button to create random parameters.
   2. Renew GUI code to close window automatically after setup is done.
   
 Week 6:
   1. Redesign color setting for interface.
