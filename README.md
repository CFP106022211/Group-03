## II. Goal
simulate the motion of two blocks sliding on fixed verticle axes, connected to each other by springs. because we like Kuo An.

## III. Step
1. Write down the lagrangian

2. Put it in python language

3. Simulate

4. Create gorgeous visual interface for setting parameter.

## V. Work Log

 Week 1:
   1. Started to search for physical simulation online, tried to download Vpython and failed.
   2. Write down the lagrangian and find the solution in complex form.
   
 Week 2:
   1. Tried to download Vpython and failed again.
   2. Gave up on Vpython-powered 3D animation, turned to animation.FuncAnimation, obtained y-t graph and 2D simulation.
   
 Week 3:
   1. Realized the animation looked oddly unrealistic, check for bug. Added complex conjugate to the solution and got much better. 
   2. Drew the phase diagram for both masses.
   
 Week 4:
   1. Set up GUI to control parameters of the system.
   2. Debug and refine.
   
 Week 5:
   1. Create "random" button to create random parameters.
   2. Renew GUI code to close window automatically after setup is done.
   
 Week 6:
   1. Redesign color setting for interface.
   
 ## VI. Individual Contribution
 
 李巧柔 
   1. In charge of most part of the code construction throughout the entire process.
   2. Learned to set up GUI via online videos.
   
 尹辰恩
   1. Provide analytical solution to the problem.
   2. Took part in the coding process with good effort in debugging.
   
 廖健一
   1. Double-checked on the analytical solution.
   2. Main presenter in the weekly update report.
   
 林祉均
   1. Put in considerable effort in Vpython installation
   2. Provide inspiration in group discussion concerning debug and visual design
   3. Wrote this weekly work log
   
 許承平
   1. Online researcher for new ideas in coding
   2. Dealt with problems in process of development
